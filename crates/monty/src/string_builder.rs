//! Resource-tracked builder for `String` values.
//!
//! `StringBuilder` is the canonical way to build a Python-visible string whose
//! final size is *not* already bounded by an already-tracked input. Operations
//! that grow a `String` in a loop — padding methods (`ljust`, `center`, …),
//! tab expansion, string repetition, container `repr()`, etc. — must use
//! `StringBuilder` rather than `String::with_capacity(...).push(...)`, because
//! the intermediate `String` lives on the Rust heap *outside* the
//! [`ResourceTracker`]. Without a builder, a malicious script can amplify a
//! small tracked input into a multi-gigabyte intermediate before the final
//! [`allocate_string`](crate::types::str::allocate_string) ever consults the
//! tracker — bypassing the configured memory limit and OOMing the host.
//!
//! # Active reservation, not preview
//!
//! Each growth actively *reserves* bytes with the tracker via
//! [`ResourceTracker::on_grow`]. This matters because Monty allows nested
//! operations: a [`str.join`](crate::types::str) over arbitrary objects can
//! invoke user-defined `__str__`/`__repr__` methods, which may themselves
//! build strings. A preview-only check (`check_estimated_size`) would let the
//! inner build pass against the *committed* memory state while ignoring the
//! outer builder's in-progress buffer — so the two could collectively exceed
//! the configured memory limit. By reserving instead, the outer builder's
//! bytes are visible to every nested operation, and the limit applies
//! cumulatively. Reservations are released on drop (cleanup on `?` /
//! early-return paths) or in [`finish`](StringBuilder::finish), which folds
//! the handoff to [`allocate_string`](crate::types::str::allocate_string)
//! into a single method so the final size is re-added via `on_allocate`
//! without double-counting and without exposing the brief release window to
//! callers.
//!
//! # Growth policy
//!
//! Capacity doubles on each growth (matching `Vec`'s policy), so an `n`-byte
//! build incurs `O(log n)` tracker calls rather than `O(n)`. Use
//! [`with_capacity`](StringBuilder::with_capacity) when an upper bound is
//! known up front (e.g. padding to a width) — a single reservation covers
//! every subsequent push. Use [`new`](StringBuilder::new) when the size is
//! not bounded up front.
//!
//! # Two APIs: direct push and `fmt::Write`
//!
//! Callers that build strings imperatively use [`push`](StringBuilder::push)
//! and [`push_str`](StringBuilder::push_str), which return [`ResourceError`]
//! directly. Callers that need to plug into `fmt::Write`-based machinery
//! (`write!`, `format_args!`, the existing `py_repr_fmt` recursion) use the
//! builder's [`fmt::Write`] impl, which captures any [`ResourceError`] into
//! an internal slot since `fmt::Error` is payload-free. The stored error is
//! surfaced automatically by [`finish`](StringBuilder::finish), so the
//! tracker error reaches the caller even when the intermediate
//! `fmt::Error` is swallowed by a downstream formatter.
