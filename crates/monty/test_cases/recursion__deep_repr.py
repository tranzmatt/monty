# max-recursion-depth=10

# Test that deeply nested lists don't crash during repr().
# The `max-recursion-depth` directive caps Monty's limit at 10, so any input
# deeper than that exercises the truncation path. CPython has its own (much
# higher) default limit and produces a full repr — the assertion accepts
# both shapes.

# Deeply nested one-element tuples must hit the same depth guard, otherwise
# `repr()` recurses unbounded and overflows the host Rust stack.
