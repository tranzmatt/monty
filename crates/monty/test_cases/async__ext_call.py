# gather sees the awaiter slot already taken and raises RuntimeError. In
# CPython the test harness now returns an already-resolved `asyncio.Future`,
# which permits multi-await, so both gathers settle with `[99]`. Both
# outcomes are accepted as they reflect a genuine semantic difference (Monty
# rejects concurrent awaiters on a `Pending` future; multi-awaiter on
# `Pending` is a planned follow-up).
